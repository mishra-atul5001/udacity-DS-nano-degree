# Tweet Sentiment Extraction - Capstone Project Â®

### Motivation of this Project

Everyone talks about Elon Musk and his `Twitter` Saga. And voila, we landed at how sentiments are influenced, by words - right, well if we have those words annoatated, can we build a solution to classify a tweet as `Positive/Neutral/Negative`?
We are into the era of **`Generative AI`** where NLP has seen some breakthrough techniques like **`Transformers, Bi-directional LSTM, LargeLM models`**.

So,our problem statemt is: **`Tweet Sentiment Extraction`**.

### Libraries used:
- pandas
- stats
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- spacy
    - spacy.ner -> creating blank `ner` pipeline
    - spacy.Examples -> split the examples in batches
    - spacy.util.minibatch and spacy.util.compounding
- warnings

### Inferences 
1. People tend to explain their reasoning behind a Neutral review.
2. Quite a few stopwords and punctuations removed. This resulted in increased Jaccard Score, measuring the capability of oure power of predicting correct texts.
3. No major missings rows or data transformation required apart form extracting entities logically given that sentences are in sequence.
