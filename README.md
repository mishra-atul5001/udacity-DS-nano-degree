# Project 1: Writing a Data Scientist Blog Post
### Project Notebook/Blog Link:
  - Notebook Link: https://github.com/mishra-atul5001/udacity-DS-nano-degree/blob/main/World%20Energy%20Consumption.ipynb
  - Blog Link: https://medium.com/@mishra5001/quick-ml-hands-on-time-series-eda-5be93eeda4ae

### Motivation of the Project:
  - Introductory aproach towards Data Science CRISP-DM Framework in pratical use. This project enlightens towards the technology and how the same could be used to solve a real world problem of Diabetes.
 
### Libraries used:
  - sklearn -> For Modelling and evaluating Model performance
  - pandas | numpy -> For data loading and Manipulation to make it modelling ready.
  - seaborn | matplotlib -> For vizualization purpose.
  - fbprophet -> Time Series Modelling

### Necessary files inside the folder:
  - Ipynb notebook demonstrating the project problem statement and respective approach + solution
  - CSV file containing dataset
  - ZIP file containing the dataset CSV.
